# Multiwire chamber simulation
This project is about a multiwire chamber simulation of 16 detection channels, with an effective detection area of $10$ x $10cm$, and its use combined with a veto system, based on a scintillating plastic.

# Multiwire chamber
The simulation design consists, in a chamber of $10$ × $10$ × $1.1cm$, containing a gas of composition $90\%$ Argon y $10\%$ Methane, with 16 Tungsten and Gold alloy fibers at $5-7\%$ with a diameter of $0.001in$, around each of these fibers we will have a radial electric, these fibers are, also, sensitive detectors. This camera will be incised perpendicularly in the $-z$ direction, by muons at $4GeV$ generated randomly and uniformly at the edge of the sensitive surface of the camera. Since this is an ionization detector, only electromagnetic and not optical processes are considered, it will be necessary to add physical processes such as muon ionization and electron ionization.

# Veto detector
The simulation design consists, in a PVT plastic and $0.5\%$ benzophenone of $10$ x $10$ x $0.6cm$, coated with $0.001in$ thick aluminum tape. A $0.3cm$ silicon photodetector diode is placed on one side. The plastic will be incised perpendicularly in the $-z$ direction, by muons at $4GeV$ generated uniformly on the plastic surface.
